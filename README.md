# Image-to-Text-to-Audio
## 📝 Project Overview
This program demonstrates a simple pipeline that extracts text from an image and converts it into speech. It uses Tesseract OCR to recognize text from the image and Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) to generate audio from the extracted text.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python

- Tesseract OCR

- pytesseract – Python wrapper for Tesseract

- Pillow (PIL) – For image processing

- gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) – For converting text to audio

- IPython.display.Audio – To play the audio in Google Colab

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Image Upload: The user loads an image containing text.

2. Text Extraction: Tesseract OCR reads the text from the image.

3. Text-to-Speech Conversion: The extracted text is converted to speech using gTTS.

4. Audio Playback: The resulting audio is saved as an MP3 file and played in the notebook.

## 📁 File Structure
- `Picture1.png` – Input image file (replace with your own image).

- `hello.mp3` – Output audio file generated from extracted text.

- `main.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook/Colab notebook with the complete implementation.

## ✅ How to Run
1. Upload your image (e.g., `Picture1.png`) to the Colab environment.

2. Run the notebook cells step by step.

3. The program will:

   - Print the extracted text.

   - Generate and save an audio file.

   - Play the audio in the notebook.
